Java Quiz Application Documentation

Overview:
This documentation provides an in-depth insight into the Java Quiz Application, a mini project crafted for educational purposes. The application is designed to assess users' understanding of Java programming through an interactive quiz containing multiple-choice questions. Leveraging Java Swing for its graphical user interface (GUI) and event handling capabilities, the application offers a seamless platform for engaging with the quiz.

Requirements:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or newer
- Any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) supporting Java (optional, for streamlined development)
- MySQL for database setup

Libraries and Technologies Used:
1. Java Swing: Utilized for constructing the GUI components such as windows, buttons, labels, and panels.
2. Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): Employed for handling user interaction events like button clicks.
3. java.util.List: Used for dynamically managing the list of quiz questions and options.
4. Database Connectivity (JDBC): Facilitates seamless integration with databases for enhanced functionality.

Implementation Details:
Main Features:
1. Question Display: Sequential presentation of multiple-choice questions.
2. Answer Selection: Users can choose answers from provided options using radio buttons.
3. Navigation: Enables users to move between questions using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
4. Score Calculation: Automatically computes the user's score based on correct answers.
5. Database Integration (optional): Supports storage and retrieval of quiz data from a database.

Function Descriptions:
- initializeQuiz(): Sets up the quiz by loading questions, initializing GUI, and navigation buttons.
- displayQuestion(int questionIndex): Displays a specific question and its options on the GUI.
- calculateScore(): Computes the user's score based on answers.
- showResult(): Presents the user's score in a new window for feedback.
- connectToDatabase(): Establishes a connection to a database for data storage and retrieval.

Usage:

1. **Insert MySQL Connector JAR:**
   - Download the `mysql-connector-java-8.3.0.jar` file.
   - Insert the JAR file into the application's library or classpath. This allows the application to communicate with the MySQL database.

2. **Update Database Credentials:**
   - Open the source code of the Java Quiz Application.
   - Locate the database connection settings, typically found in a separate configuration file or within the source code itself.
   - Update the username and password fields with the appropriate credentials required to connect to your MySQL database.

3. **Compile and Run the Application:**
   - Compile the updated source code, ensuring that the MySQL Connector JAR is included in the classpath.
   - Run the compiled application.

4. **Operate the Application:**
   - Navigate through the questions using the provided GUI controls.
   - Select answers to the multiple-choice questions.
   - Use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to move between questions.
   - Submit the quiz once you have answered all questions.

5. **View Results:**
   - After submitting the quiz, the application will calculate your score.
   - If database integration is implemented, the application may store your quiz results in the MySQL database.
   - You can view your score and any additional feedback provided by the application.

By following these steps and ensuring that the MySQL Connector JAR is added to the library and the database credentials are updated, you can successfully operate the Java Quiz Application with MySQL database integration.
Extending the Application:

Conclusion:
The Java Quiz Application showcases the practical application of Java Swing, AWT, and JDBC in creating an interactive desktop application. It serves as a valuable learning tool for Java programmers of all levels, offering a fun and engaging way to test and improve their Java skills while introducing database interaction concepts.
